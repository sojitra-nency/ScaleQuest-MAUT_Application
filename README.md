# ScaleQuest 

Welcome to the ScaleQuest-MAUT (Multi-Attribute Utility Theory) application! This repository contains the code and data files for a powerful decision-making tool that uses MAUT analysis. The application is hosted on Streamlit and can be accessed at [https://maut-1234.streamlit.app/](https://maut-1234.streamlit.app/).

## Key Features

- **Consolidated Data**: The `Consolidated data.xlsx` file provides a comprehensive dataset for the analysis.
- **Normalized Data**: Use the `Consolidated data_normalized.csv` file, which contains preprocessed and normalized data for accurate calculations.
- **Advanced MAUT Techniques**: Explore different MAUT approaches with Jupyter Notebooks:
  - `MAUT_1.ipynb`: Perform MAUT analysis with customizable parameters.
  - `MAUT_AHP.ipynb`: Utilize Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for weighted decision-making.
  - `MAUT_LOSS.ipynb`: Optimize decision-making using Linear Optimization for Stochastic Systems (LOSS).
  - `MAUT_TOPSIS.ipynb`: Employ Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for ranking alternatives.
- **Streamlit Application**: Experience the interactive and user-friendly MAUT application by running `app.py` locally.

## Visualization and Workflow

To help you understand the analysis and workflow, we provide visual representations of the MAUT analysis in PNG format:
